Zpider eShop is a Web based eShop solution fully integrated with the ERP-systems Visma Global and Visma Business.

With the Setup Wizard, an eShop is easily installed and ready to run in a few minutes. The eShop includes functionality like persistent shopping cart, product search, product categorization and hierarchical browsing, ordering information, order status and order history, quick orders, purchase lists, related articles, credit card payment, simple document publishing and moreâ€¦

An administrator will have access to the Web based administration program eShop Administration (short name eShop admin) to configure the system, by administrating menus, images, texts, documents, changing the colors and logos plus much more.

The eShop Administration application provides access to administration menus by clicking one of the following tabs:

- Getting started
- System Administration
- Administrating users
- Working with design
- Managing content
- Visual editing

Note: By clicking the help icon (question mark) in the upper right corner of most menus, a help window will be displayed.

The eShop administrator can configure the various elements of the eShop by clicking the menus.

Launch eShop: To get a preview of the changes done in eShop admin the eShop administrator can click the Launch eShop menu.

Commit changes: For the changes to take effect for users of the eShop, click the Commit Changes menu. Before you commit the changes they will only be available for the administrator user when you click the Launch eShop menu. The eShop users will not see the changes until they are committed by the administrator.

If you do not commit the changes before logging out or quitting the browser you will get the following message the next time you log in as an administrator:

Logout: The Log out menu will log out the administrator of eShop Administration.

Debug: By clicking this menu the debug form will appear. The fdebug form provides extended eShop administrator functionality. Read more about the functionality of the debug form in the Online documentation.

Error: By clicking this menu the error form will appear. Read more about the error menu in the Online documentation.

When you log in and an administrator is already logged in you will get a warning massage:

If more than one administrator is logged in at the same time it is important to realize that committing changes will include uncommitted changes by other administrators. eShop admin is designed as a single user application. If more than one administrator is making changes it is imperative that they coordinate the changes before committing.

Please note that if you exit eShop admin by other means than clicking the Logout menu the administrator session will be active until it times out (typically 20 minutes). Thus you may get the message above even if no other administrators are logged in to eShop admin. You should always exit eShop admin by clicking the Logout menu.
