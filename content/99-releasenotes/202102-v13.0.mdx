## News
- .Net Framework 4.8 is now required
- All themes are now using theme.json to reference js and css
- The upgrade process is vastly improved
- New and updated web editor for themes and templates
- Use eventlisteners to hook into events in Zpider and do things like validation
- Check out as guest can now be enabled. Current guest user is then used to place the order in ERP.
- Password hashing is now done using BCrypt. Existing users are converted upon login.
- Database service to query the ERP database directly from Zpider. Can use htx function SqlQuery if enabled.

## Fixed issues
 - Bug in plugin installer in chrome
 - The upgrade process no longer overwrites database config files
 - Duplicate emails 
    - If a customer was unable to be exported to Zpider due to duplicate loginid they might end up in a loop getting an email with a new username and password every day. No more.
 - During upgrade it would reset the client id in the configuration, and ruin any custom configuration to a copied client.
 - The upgrade process timeout is increased 
 - StockIncChanges can now be used in the shopping cart as well
 - Importing customers can now be restricted to a set of import profiles. Useful if you are running multiple installtions on the same erp client.

 - NewUser: CompanyName is an alias for Name in order to avoid browser autocomplete and utilise Brønnøysund lookup.
