## News
- .Net Framework 4.8 is now required
- All themes are now using theme.json to reference js and CSS
- The upgrade process is vastly improved
- Updated preview admin with dashboard and general configuration.
- New and updated web editor for themes and templates
- Use event listeners to hook into events in Zpider and do things like validation
- Check out as guests can now be enabled. The current guest user is then used to place the order in ERP.
- Password hashing is now done using BCrypt. Existing users are converted upon login.
- Database service to query the ERP database directly from Zpider. Can use HTX function SqlQuery if enabled.
- Unit conversion can now be enabled (using QuantityPerUnitSale for Visma Global)

## Fixed issues
 - Bug in plugin installer in chrome
 - The upgrade process no longer overwrites database config files
 - During the upgrade it would reset the client id in the configuration, and ruin any custom configuration to a copied client.
 - The upgrade process timeout is increased 
 - If a customer was unable to be exported to Zpider due to a duplicate login id they might end up in a loop getting an email with a new username and password every day. No more.
 - StockIncChanges can now be used in the shopping cart as well
 - Importing customers can now be restricted to a set of import profiles. Useful if you are running multiple installations on the same ERP client.
 - Email validation in admin is updated
 - VAF logging is improved for Visma Global.
 - On WebUser the CompanyName is now an alias for Name to avoid browser autocomplete and utilize Brønnøysund lookup.
 - The length of ZpiderOrder.CreditCardTransactionId is extended to 50
 - Cache web user and customer for reuse for guests. This has a huge impact on installations with a lot of traffic.
 - Lazy load server version and web server version instead of upon logon
 - Correctly dispose of SQL connections
 - An XSS issue is fixed
 - The PersistentCache is rewritten to be more performant
 - Show window would break if a group contained an invalid character
 - Each Zpider application will now get a numbered application pool name
 - Values on a customer, orders, etc can now be set to 0 if needed.
 - DefaultUriProvider now handles only having the gid passed to it. This means that <z:url gid=[groupnumber]/> now works correctly without adding a plugin.
 - The timeout in forgotten password is increased from 3 to 30 seconds.
 - Cultures in emails are now validated so that only activated cultures are used for a new user during import.
