## Fixed issues

- Fusion service thread pool starvation and many memory leaks are fixed
- The PersistentCache is improved and the core functionality is rewritten
- Huge improvements to the grouplist and menuitem handling. In one instance we saw the render of the grouplist go from 2000ms to 60ms.
- Global Integration: If the user is a contact the correct values for ContactNoInvoice and NameContactNoInvoice will be set on ZpiderOrder
- WebAttributes with format DefaultDate now supports HTML5 date inputs
- If a date property was set to empty or null on ZpiderOrder it would throw an error
- During upgrade the SMTP username and password would be lost
- If the disk ran out of space the Fusion Service would not start because of corrupted message files
- If the current payment method is not supported the first available will be selected (think invoice is not available, but credit card is)

## HTX templates

There's additions to the template system in this version.

### <z:write

#### format 

Use this to format a value (or multiple values). You can have multiple values by naming them value1, value2 etc.

```
<z:write format="{0:00}" value=1.029>
## prints 1.03
```

#### transform

Use this to transform the string to `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `ucfirst` or `ucwords`

```
<z:write value="this was lowercase" transform="ucwords">
## prints This Was Lowercase
```

#### trim

If set to "true" or "t" it will trim the output.

### <z:prepare

The prepare tag now supports pagesize so that pagination can be initialized without running `<z:foreach` over a dataclass.

If the filter-attribute is provided but empty it will be skipped. This is convenient if a session variable might be set for filtering products.

### <z:meta

You can now use `<z:meta property="og:description">Open graph description</z:meta>` to set open graph meta tags. The meta tag now supports all values for name, and these will be set in the header.

### <z:url

The url tag is now using the IUrlProvider under the covers.

### <z:include

All parameters set on the include tag will be available or override the `$z:config[attr]` in the included template.

```
## template/module a:
<z:include module="b" some_attr="test" />

## template/module b:
this will say "test": $z:config[some_attr]
```

In addition if you try to include a control that fails or does not exist it will return an error-box for administrator and empty for a user.

### $z:plugin

This allows access to installed plugins. Use `$z:plugin[name.enabled] eq "T"` to check if a plugin is installed. 

Other properties will execute `T GetProperty(string name)` on the class inheriting from ZpiderPlugin.

### $z:text

The text entity will no longer return ?TXT_NAME? etc if a text is missing unless you are admin.

### Support dataclass extended

The support dataclass (`$z:value[support...]`) has been extended with the following values

- ShowWindowRows
- ShowWindowColumns
- IntermediateGroupAdd
- SubGroupAdd
- CurrentCulture
- CurrentCultureName
- CurrentCulturePhoneCode
- DirectOrder (Current user is guest and DirectOrder is enabled)
- IsGuestUser
- OpenWebshop
- RawUrl (Current request RawUrl)

HomePage now returns the HomePage relative to the application path.

### HTX in general

There's been some issues relating to nullvalues and exceptions, and these are taken care of.

If you need to force credit card payment only you can set `OnlyCreditCardAsPayment` to `true` on the session-scope.

```<z:set scope="session" name="OnlyCreditCardAsPayment">true</z:set>```
