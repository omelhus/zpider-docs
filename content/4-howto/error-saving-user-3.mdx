title: "Fix error saving user (3)"

### Issue

Zpider is returning `Error saving user. 3` when you change user details or password in User Administration.

### Solution

This is usually because the connection with the ERP database is broken. Try restarting the Zpider Fusion Service, and if that does not fix the issue referr to `debug.log` on the application server.
